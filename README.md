Repo for Team Moon Pie in [Eric's Puzzle Party 15][0]

[0]: http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/2015/

We'll use this repo to organize scripts and tools for efficiently
cracking Eric's puzzles. As a rule, we'll try to use Ruby, although
certain tools may require e.g. Python (such as if we want to
[solve pentominos][1]).

Overview
--------

- With the pi theme, we'll want easy access to the digits of pi. We've added
  pi in various bases (only the numerals), but maybe we want to write
  code to serialize those files in a more useful manner (e.g. searching
  for sequences of digits).
